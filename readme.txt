These images should be used in your1st CodeReview project.

For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded:

(10) Correct usage of <img> to present images on the web page

(15) Use CSS selectors (classes and/or IDs) to style your web page ( the colors, font size, font style etc.).

 

Bonus Points:
